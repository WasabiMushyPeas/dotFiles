                                    Start
  - Make sure that I have the "State Driver Handbook"
  - Study the "New Mexico Driver Handbook"
  - Also study Level 1 Witten test
                                    Studying
                                  --Level 1--
#   Are you Ready?
  - HTS (Highway Transportation System) made up a three parts People, Vehicles, and Roadways
  - HTS is manged by the federal (which lay the base rules) and the local governments
  - Roads North and south have odd numbers; even numbers are East and West (the higher the number the further east it is)
  - GDL (Graduated Driver Licensing) is an extended period of surpervised driving to give more experince to new drivers
  - Parents need preventing kids from driving at night
  - don't drive alone in the first 6 months that you get your license

#   Adolescent Physiology and Driving
  - Three skills you need to drive are Control of the Vehicle, Maneuvering the Vehicle, and Planning
  - Part of the reason way teen driving is dangorous is because the prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain that handles judgment) is less developed
  - Also in teen years teenagers have less myelination coating around their nerves making sutiation assment harder and slower
  - On top of this as the brain is developing it goes through a proces called pruning (which is where the brain gets rid of all unneaded nerves) 
during pruning the person does not have the brain power to multitask and make good decisions
  - This leads to safty sometimes being trumped by thrill seeking (especaily with friends)
  - The GDL is one of the first attempts to take teens natuarl limititions into account to make driving more safe
  - The extra time GDL provides allows teens to establish good driving habits help their brain develop leading to safe automatic reactions
  - Driving is a privilege and can been earned by mature behavour blah blah blah (The Driving Philosophy)
  - Most states allow parents to legal put restrictions on teen driving
  - The threat of lossing driving prevelages causes teens to be more resposable

#   The Mechanics of Driving
  - The steering system is the interface that allows the driver to change the angle of the front wheels 
(usally powered steering, a hydraulic pump powered by a belt connected to the engine)
  - The steering wheel is connected to the steering column which turns the rotorary motion into linear motion on the steering linkage (powerd steering makes it easer to turn)
  - To maintain the steering system don't steer when your not moving, don't force the wheel to it's limit, avoide impacts as they can knock the steering out of line, 
when checking oil check the power steering system
  - The Suspension helps smooth out the car ride and keeps the wheels pointed in the right direction.
  - Suspension does not usally fail immediately a sign of failure is cupping (uneven tier wear)
  - The tiers take most of the shock (more to suspension usally)
  - The tiers allow the car to exert force on the ground
  - There are two types of tier construtions bias ply (the layers of cord and rubber are criss-crossed) making it more impact resistance; And Radial ply 
(where the ply's are parallel but perpendicular to the tread) making a more flexable and long lasting but on impact can cause belt separation lead to a blowout
  - Radial tiers should be at 35 psi where bias tiers should be at 32 psi
  - Always check the treads and psi
  - Tiers are rated by the Uniform Tire Quality Grading System which is a scale of ABC A being the best C being the meeting minimum requirment
  - The breaking system slows down the tier via friction
  - Break Components:
  Disc Braeak - Break by pinching a metal disc with special break pads (they a usually on the front wheels which do 70% of the braking)
  Drum Brakes - An enclosed system where break shoe pushes on a drum
  Dual Master Cylinder - Two cylinders that are independent of one another the pressurize the break fluid
  Brake Lines - steel tubes that carry brake fluid under pressure
  Power Brake - Just like powered steering makes it easier for the driver to break (It is also designed when the engine fails the breaks can work one last time)
  Parking Brake (Emergency Break) - Uses cables and levers to break the rear breaks (independent from the hydraulic breaks) should be engaged when parking
  - The fuel system is designed to provid the right amount of fuel and air to the engine
  - Fuel System Components:
  Fuel Tank - duh (also has the fuel gauge though)
  Fuel Lines - tubes the connect to the carburetor/injection system
  Carburetor/Fuel Injection - throttled by the peddle it controls the fuel and air mixture that enters the engine (Fuel Injection it more common)
  Fuel Filter - Removes contaminants form the fuel
  Fuel Pump - Pumps fuel through the fuel lines
  Air Filter - Cleans contaminants from the air
  Choke - Decreases air flow to the pistons intern increasing idle speed (used when cold)
  Turbo - Increases the air flow to the pistons
  Ignition System - Take (alot) of power from the car battery and shorts in making a spark igniting the fuel in the engine
  Charging System - Feeds of the enige providing power while the car is runing
  Starting System - The HID that allows the driver to start the engine
  Accessory Circuits - Lights, safty systems, etc. Hooked up to a fuse and any system the need electricity
#   Your State and Your Permission to Drive
  - The process of getting a drivers license is manged by the New Mexico Graduated Licensing Law
